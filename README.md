# BasicRoboticVacuumCleaner
My first AI project. A robot vacuum cleaner that cleans dirty tiles in a 2-D environment with random obstacles.

## Overview
* Robot allows to move up, down, left, right direction only.
* Robot allows to move a tile per Action.
* The environment is filled with randomized obstacles or impassable.
* The robot will eventually clean all the tiles unless the given of number of steps are restricted or limited.
